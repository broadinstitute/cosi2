Title: Terms

Terms and concepts used throughout the documentation.

Term: recombination

Short for "crossover recombination".

Term: end

The generation at which an event ends, in the forward sense; in other words, the
generation at which we first encounter the event when simulating backwards.

Term: start

The generation at which an event starts, in the forward sense; when simulating backwards,
this is the last generation at which we see the effects of the event.

Term: sampling loc

Sometimes we are running simulations to get the sampling distribution of a statistic at a particular
location within the simulated region (relative to a specific genetic map).
In such a case we can greatly optimize the simulation by ignoring details that do not affect
the value of that statistic at that location.  For example, if computing an iHH-based statistic at
given location, we may be able to ignore recombination events in the direction away from the location.

Term: leaf

An ARG node of generation 0.0, representing a present-day individual chrom sampled from a present-day population.

Term: ARG

Ancestral Recombination Graph.  Note that during a simulation, cosi keeps only the active frontier
of the ARG (nodes that do not yet have a parent).  So 'ARG' in the documentation may refer either to
the full ARG, or to the small subset of the ARG that we actually keep.

Term: region

The simulated region

Term: simulation

One simulation replica.  In other contexts "simulation" might refer to multiple replicas,
but in cosi documentation "simulation" refers to a single simulation replica.  One cosi run
can involve doing a number of simulation replicas, "simulations" for short.
