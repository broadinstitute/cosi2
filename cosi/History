July 1  2011   Big changes:

         Added "sentinel" method of detecting regions that have coalesced,
         replacing original dg_done_coalescent() code.

			Changed how mutations are placed on the genealogy: instead of tracing each
			individual mutation down the genealogy, for each segment of each seglist
			we compute the set of leaves that get any mutations carried by that segment.
			These leafsets are constructed incrementally as new seglists are constructed.
			This replaces the sim_mutate() step.

			Changed the simulator to keep only the currently active nodes (those currently
			in a Pop) and place mutations as we go along, instead of first constructing
			the entire ARG and then placing mutations on it.  This reduces memory usage
			and improves data locality.

         Changed Seglist representation to be a flat vector of
			[ beg_0 end_0 beg_1 end_1 ... beg_k end_k ].

			Small changes:

         Changed Seglist representation to be a flat vector of
			[ beg_0 end_0 beg_1 end_1 ... beg_k end_k ].  (This lets us
			quickly check if a location falls on a segment or in a gap,
			by doing one binary search and checking the parity of the
			resulting index).

			Changed the remove operation on nodelists to run in constant time:
			removed element is now replaced with the last element of the array,
			instead of shifting all elements above the removed element.
			This is ok since the order of nodes within a population is unimportant.

June 08 2011	Remove segment.h/c (replaced by seglist). Add one "break" when getting
     		head node. V06-07-11a.

June 07 2011	Turn segments into arrays as well; no output change. V06-07-11a.
     		(Adds seglist.h/c)

June 01 2011	Turn list of recomb sites into arrays. Still no output change. 
     		Tag as V06-01-01a.

May 31 2011	Get rid of definition of rsitenum (= int). Tagged as V05-31-11a.

May 26 2011	Tidying things up in a number of places: Turn poplist into array, and 
       		eliminate poplist arguments from 2 dg_ functions (getting pop by name). 
		No longer remobe migrations to/from non-existent pops Do not add 
		migration if rate is zero (Historical.c deletes previous migration, and 
		new one has no effect.) Have migration hold pop pointers, rather than 
		names. Change dg_coalesce_by_name to dg_coalesce_by_pop. No change to 
		output.  Tag as V05-26-11a.

May 17 2011	Add protection to sweep.c, so that will not end sweep with nsel=2 (only happens for 
       		large s).

May 6 2011	One more header problem that I left behind. Removed multiplying random seed by -1, to 
      		make compatible with transition to mtwist in cosi2_rand (rile.c). Tag as V05-06-11a. 
		(Correction: some things weren't tagged right. Tag as V05-10-11a.)

May 4 2011	Cleaned up various header-related issues. No functional changes. Tag as V05-04-11a.

May 3 2011	Remove obsolete copyright notice. Add some $\ID lines. 
      		Update to new directory for cosi2_rand header files. Added nested-header protetion to 
		some .h files.  Tag as V05-03-11a.

Apr 12 2011	Import from cosi for renewed development. Tag as V04-12-11a.

=================================================================================================
Nov 08 2010	Make error output more specific when invalid parameter is encountered in reading 
       		file. Not tagged, but included in 

Jul 19 2010	Swap indices in sweep_execute(), when deciding which gene conversion chunk has the 
       		parental allele. The existing code was backwards (i.e. wrong), as Ilya discovered.

		Tag as V071910a

Jun 9 2007	Add line to geneconversion.c so that overall rate is calculated both when length 
		and when rate set. Otherwise, specifying length param first => no gene conversion.

Mar 29 2007	Remove test in sweep.c that ends sweep when down to single selected chrom, since 
		recombination onto selected allele could still occur (should be minor effect).

Nov 16 2006	Remove debugging output from sweep.c. Fix error in sweep:sw_recomb_pick_popindex, 
		where I was incorrectly staggering random counter by 0.5, leading to possibility 
		of picking population with zero members.

Nov 15 2006	Modify sweep to output selected allele. Tag as V080906a.
		New param format: 
		pop_event sweep "selective sweep" 5[pop] 10000[time] .02[s] .5[pos] .4[final freq]

Oct 19 2006	-g becomes -O3 in Makefile.

		Tag as V080906a.

Jan 27 2006	Uncovered modest conceptual bug in sweep.c: was summing probability of event over 
		time intervals until passed random threshold. This is wrong, since the sum will
		deterministically exceed 1.0, while the probability of nothing happens is always 
		> 0.  Instead, calc only prob in current time slice and toss random number every slice.

Jan 24 2006	Working on sweep with other populations present. Revise simulator.c to always 
		check whether done after historical event, and change some function names
		in demography.c to make more consistent interface.

Jan 17 2006	Code modifications for speed. Now keep track of how many active nodes there
		are for each location (i.e. for each segment), to reduce checking.
		Also tried maintaining list of nodes associated with each segment (see forays/demography.stage2), 
		but ran slower under most circumstances.
		V011806a.

Sep 22 2005	Add copyright.  V09-22-05a.  Replace as Release 1.0.

Sep 16 2005	Release 1.0.

June 21 2005	Bug fix in bottleneck.c -- require at least 2 nodes to attempt bottleneck execution.  V06-21-6a.

April 26 2005 	Removed increment to time after bottleneck (historical.c), since it was screwing up historical events
unless spaced by >= 1 gen.  V04-26-05a.

Feb 4 2005	Tract length change somehow failed to get into tagged version (but was tranferred to public_html, etc)
Retag as V02-04-05a.

Nov 5 2004	Gene conversion tract length set to 500 bp.  V11-05-04a.  Moving this to public_html area.

Oct 19 2004	Switched to having start end of partial sweep be number of chromosomes. V10-19-04a.

Oct 18 2004	Add partial selective sweeps (either end).  V10-18-04a.

Oct 10 2004	Minor tweaks to make work on MPG unix machines.  V10-14-04a.

Oct 6 2004	Fixed bug in exponential expansion (malloc'd 2 instead of 3 
slots for params).  V10-06-04b

Oct 6 2004	Fixed 2 bugs.  One old one in sweep.c (overrunning array bounds, 
used realloc), one in output.c (stray line removed). V10-06-04a.

Oct 5 2004	Hardwired some code in dg_coalescent_done for speed (~15% gain 
in a sample of 1).  Implemented infinite and finite sites.  V10-05-04a.

Oct 4 2004	Cleaning up: switched to using header files instead of 
stand-alone declarations in a few places, got rid of sim_nummuts call-through.
Also, a few small changes to try to increase speed.  V10-04-04b.

Oct 4 2004	Switched to using different poisson routine, this one 
cosi_rand.  V10-04-04a.

Oct 1 2004 	Cleaning up: removed unused file.h, removed unneeded
comments from headers (in function declarations), made header file 
names lower case.  V10-01-04a.

Sep 29 2004	Added option of fixed number of segregating sites.
V09-29-04a.

Sep 28 2004 	Fix bug in migration: swap order of populations, so
declared migration is forward in time. V09-28-04b.

Sep 27 2004 	Change admixture to simply move some chromosomes.  Only
change is that it no longer sets the population size of the target
population.  V09-28-04a.

Sep 24 2004 	Direct output of haps and pos files now works.  Identical
output except for roundoff error from reading seg.  Chromosomes in
different populations now get unique chromosome ids.  Got rid of //
comments so everything compiles with -ansi flag.  Tag V09-24-04a.

Aug 19 2004 	Update location of random.a, clean up setting of random
seed.

Aug 19 2004 	Kill seg and log output if no output file specified.  Tag
V08-19-04a.

Aug 18 2004	Moved into local CVS.  Tag V08-18-04a
