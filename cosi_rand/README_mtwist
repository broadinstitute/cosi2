The following files were taken from the mtwist-0.8 library: mtwist.c,
mtwist.h, mtwist.3. Here is the relevant portion of the README for
that library:

This is an implementation of the Mersenne Twist pseudorandom number
generator, including both C and C++ interfaces and a set of functions
for generating random variates from common distributions.

To compile, you may need to define MT_NOINLINE or MT_LONG_LONG.

The full documentation for the package is in the manual pages,
mtwist.3.

For more information, see the Web page for the package, at:
